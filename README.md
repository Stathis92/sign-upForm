# sign-upForm

In this project we create a website and try to implement a sign up form with various user input for the account creation process.
Once the user types all info then they have to click a button to confirm their choises.
We then check all inputs to verify they are correct and we proceed to complete the sign up.

(Error messages appear in console)
